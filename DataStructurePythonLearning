1.7 Exceptions Handling 
Eg:
  def sum(values):
    if not isinstance(values, collections.Iterable):    # note collections.Iterable
      raise TypeError( parameter must be an iterable type )
    total = 0
    for v in values:
      if not isinstance(v, (int, float)):     # note can judge more than one instance at a time!
        raise TypeError( elements must be numeric )
      total = total+ v
    return total

1.8 Iterators and Generators
• An iterator is an object that manages an iteration through a series of values. If
variable, i, identifies an iterator object, then each call to the built-in function,
next(i), produces a subsequent element from the underlying series, with a
StopIteration exception raised to indicate that there are no further elements.
• An iterable is an object, obj, that produces an iterator via the syntax iter(obj).
